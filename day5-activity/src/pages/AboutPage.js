    <p  style = {{fontSize: 30, color: 'blue', alignSelf: 'right'}}>Jett is a VALORANT agent who specializes in assassination and mobility. This South Korean agent, like a true ninja, can dash short distances to catch up with enemies or escape dangerous situations, and she can even propel herself upwards to reach highground places and surprise lurking targets who believe they're safe up there. Jett's Cloudburst ability combined with the Blade Storm ultimate makes her a close-combat nightmare, as she can execute enemies who won't even notice what hit them.</p>
